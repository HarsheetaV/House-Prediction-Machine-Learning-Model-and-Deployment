# House-Prediction-Machine-Learning-Model-and-Deployment
ML project on Real time Housing price prediction

This is my undergraduate major project, where i built this ML model and handed it over to a startup as part of STEP startup event.
I have not uploaded confidential parts of the project. I have included the data cleaning, outlier removal, data engineering part of the project in this git hub repository.

The technology stack involved in this project:
1) Python
2) Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3) Matplotlib for data visualization
4) Sklearn for model building
5) Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
6) Python flask for http server
7) HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI


Machine learning model is being created using scikit-learn libraries and linear regression, utilizing the Bangalore home prices dataset obtained from Kaggle.com.

The next step involves developing a Python Flask server that utilizes the trained model to serve HTTP requests. This server acts as an intermediary between the website and the prediction model.

The final component is the creation of a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This website allows users to input details such as home square footage and number of bedrooms. The website then calls the Python Flask server to retrieve the predicted price based on the provided information.

Throughout the project, various data science concepts were being covered, including data loading and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, and k-fold cross-validation.

The project employs a range of technologies and tools, including Python as the programming language, NumPy and Pandas for data cleaning, Matplotlib for data visualization, scikit-learn for model building, and Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, and PyCharm as integrated development environments (IDEs). The Python Flask framework is used for the HTTP server, while HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are utilized for the website's user interface.

Overall, this project provides a comprehensive demonstration of applying data science techniques to real estate price prediction, enabling users to learn and implement similar projects themselves. After the completion of the project, the model was handed over to the startup working on the real estate business.
